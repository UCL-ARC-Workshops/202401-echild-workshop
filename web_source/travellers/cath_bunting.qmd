eCHILD git/github training
http://tiny.cc/arc-echild-git
Day 1 - Github
Intro
Instructor: David Perez-Suarez
Helpers: Sam Cunliffe (in person) and Jonathan Cooper (online)
Learning Objectives
After this workshop, you should be able to

understand the github worflow to contribute to a repository
modify and create pages on a repository using github and/or codespaces
design the website structure
This document
We will use this document to show notes/diagrams, provide you with the exercises, and keep track of what you need to do.

To edit this document you need to change the view to edit or split mode:

HackMD screenshot showing view mode and pointing a button to switch to edit and view mode on the left top, in between edit button with a pencil icon and view button with an eye icon

If you see this page in view mode like the screen shot above, do either of the following to enable editing.

Edit mode: Ctrl+Alt+E, or click the button with a pencil on the left-top to swich to edit mode
Both mode: Ctrl+Alt+B, or click the button with a square with a vertical line in the middle
First exercise!
Find your name on the list below and cut it from the unknown section and add yourself to the In person or Online section to know where you are.

Indicate whether you‚Äôve got or not some coding experience after your name by typing Code or No Code respectively.

:warning: Let us know if your name is not in the list below or the list didn‚Äôt include your github username.

GitHub
Before getting to GitHub, let‚Äôs see how a collaboration flow works on MS Word


When using git there are a couple of differences.

changes are grouped and can cover multiple files.
Each set of changes contain a description that‚Äôs kept in the history (who made the change, why, what and when).
You can contribute to any public repository, but only the owners of that repository can accept (merge) these changes.
The review process happens on a ‚ÄúPull request‚Äù.
üì¶ Our repository for today: UCL-ARC-Workshops/202401-echild-workshop

Exercises
Exercises will be done in pairs.

In person participants, you will work with the person next to you. Our helpers will be walking around. Use your orange üüß post-it if you need help.
Remote participants, you‚Äôll be separated to breakout rooms to do so. Our remote helper will be visiting the different rooms to see how you are doing and help you if needed. You can request for help clicking ‚ÄúAsk for Help‚Äù :grey_question: button in the meeting controls.
Even though you do them in pairs, most of the exercises are supposed to be done by both members. First one person writes and the other observes, and then you swap roles.

Modify a file - more info about the cities
We‚Äôve got a cities folder in our repository with a set of files separated by continents and countries directories. Go to the file assigned to you (see below) and, in pairs, change at least two of the FIXME in the file:

write in the file the name of that city in one of their local languages or the pronunciation (You‚Äôll find that information on wikipedia);
Add a reason of what to see in that city;
Update the link to wikipedia.
Try to use any of the available styling text syntax available in markdown files.

You can add web links in markdown files following this syntax:

You can visit [website title](https://web.site/pointed/to).
If you need to link to the same page multiple times in the same file, you can use reference-style links as:

You can visit [our website][main-website] to find information about our activities and events.

If you'd like to work with us, our [main page][main-website] also contains a list of open positions.


[main-website]: https://our.web.site/
Your assigned cities:

Katie Harron - Algiers
Ruth Blackburn - Axum
Matthew Jay - Barranquilla
Rocio Mendez Pineda - Berat
Joana Pereira Da Cruz - Cape Town
Jo Lam - Casablanca
Joachim Tan - Chengdu
Farzan Ramzan - Cochabamba
Catherine Bunting - Coimbra
Laura Gimeno - Cordoba
Kate Lewis - Denver
Ania Zylbersztejn - Kolkata
Selin Akaraci - Mazatlan
Milagros Ruiz Nishiki - Perth
Tony Stone - Sendai
Save the file, create a commit as shown by the instructor and open a pull-request.

Post your link below to get someone to review it

Review contributions
Choose one of the pull-request listed above (from a different person that your
pair), add your name afterwards, and review the pull request as shown by the
instructor.
If you are happy with the changes, approve it, otherwise, request changes to
make it better. Don‚Äôt forget to thank them for their contribution.

After approving it, press the merge button that is now available.

Add a file - a new traveller
Under the travellers directory create a new file as demonstrated with your name or one of a traveller you‚Äôd like that join us.

The file needs to have a qmd extension: example.qmd.

Avoid spaces in the name, use CamelCase or snake_case if you want to put many words together. For example sara_alfarsi.qmd.

Use the following code snippet as a template for the file, so it is rendered nicely on our website. See the existing ones for inspiration.

Some templates on Quarto: https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html

Adding code to the pages
Some times, we want to publish a page that demonstrate some analysis. Quarto allows you to write some code in python, R, julia, ‚Ä¶

Let‚Äôs add to our preferred traveller a code snippet that you like.

We are going to use codespaces, so we can also see whether the result is what we want.
Codespaces is a service from github that allows you to run a development environment in the cloud.
We‚Äôve got it set so that you can open vs code, RStudio and Jupyter lab. Follow the indications of the instructor.

Codespaces is like a machine running on the cloud. Though free for public repositories, the resources are not unlimited!
Check the codespaces you‚Äôve got active and your allowance in your settings

Let‚Äôs write some code!

Start the codespaces (takes ~3 mins). Here we give you some code samples to use for R or Python, but feel free to write your own snippet.
